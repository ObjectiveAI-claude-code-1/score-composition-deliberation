Score each cat photo individually on Compositional Deliberation. Evaluate whether the photographer has made intentional, thoughtful choices about framing, angle, and subject positioning. Consider whether the placement and frame boundary suggest deliberate artistic decisions (rule of thirds, leading lines, perspective choices) versus accidental arrangement. Assign a score reflecting the degree of compositional intentionality evident in each photo.
