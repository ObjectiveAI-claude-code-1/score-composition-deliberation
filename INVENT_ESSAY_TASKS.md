1. Analyze Frame Boundaries and Composition Strategy: Examine how the photograph's borders and boundaries are used, and determine whether the choice of what to include and exclude within the frame reflects intentional compositional decisions. Look for evidence of deliberate strategies such as adherence to the rule of thirds, meaningful use of negative space, or strategic placement of elements that suggests the photographer carefully considered the frame's edges as part of their artistic vision.

2. Evaluate Camera Angle and Perspective Choices: Assess whether the camera's angle and viewpoint appear to have been deliberately selected to serve a specific artistic or communicative purpose. Determine if the chosen perspective—whether low, high, straight-on, or dynamic—reveals intentional thinking about how this angle affects the viewer's emotional response to the cat and whether it reveals something meaningful about the subject.

3. Examine Subject Positioning and Visual Emphasis: Analyze where the cat is positioned within the frame and evaluate whether this placement demonstrates deliberate thinking about visual hierarchy and emphasis. Assess whether the cat's position guides the viewer's eye effectively, whether it creates visual balance or intentional tension, and whether the placement serves the photographer's apparent compositional intent.

4. Assess Overall Visual Coherence and Compositional Logic: Evaluate the degree to which all elements within the photograph—including the cat, background, lighting, framing, and perspective—work together as a unified, intentional whole. Determine whether the composition feels cohesive and purposefully orchestrated, or whether elements appear scattered and arbitrary, revealing the extent to which the photographer has demonstrated comprehensive compositional thinking.
